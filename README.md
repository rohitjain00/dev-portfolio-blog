## Usage

To start using the theme you need to create and edit some extra files in the root directory

1. Create `blog.md` in the root folder ans set its yaml parameters to

```yaml
layout: blog
permalink: /blog/
```

2. Change your `about.md` yaml parameters to following

```yaml
layout: description
permalink: /about/
```

3. In the `_congif.yml` file add a key `resume_url` and set it to the path of the Resume.

For example if the Resume is located in the root directory

```yaml
resume_url: 'Resume.pdf'
```

home_text : some-text
author_name: your-name

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
To add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `dev-portfolio-blog.gemspec` accordingly.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
